DESCRIPTION:A Singly Linked List (SLL) is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic and allow efficient memory usage. This project implements basic operations on a singly linked list such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
